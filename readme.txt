1.Mounting Google Drive:
The code imports the necessary libraries from Google Colab
and mounts the Google Drive to the Colab notebook, allowing access 
to files stored in Google Drive.



2.Importing Libraries: 
The code imports various libraries required for the machine learning pipeline, 
including numpy, scipy, scikit-learn (sklearn), and Keras.



3.Loading Data:
 The code loads training and testing data from the specified file paths 
using the np.load() function. The data includes various sensor readings such as
 accelerometer, gyroscope, linear acceleration, etc.




4.Data Normalization:
 The code defines two functions, normalization() and normalize_one_low(),
 for normalizing the input data. The normalization() function applies
 normalization on each dimension of the input data, while the normalize_one_low() 
function normalizes a single dimension of the input data.




5.Down Sampling: 
The code defines a function, down_sample(), which currently 
doesn't have any implementation.

6.Feature Extraction: 
The code defines several functions for computing different statistical 
features from the input data, such as mean, median, standard deviation,
 variance, etc. These functions are then used to compute features for 
each segment of the data using the get_features() and segmented_features() functions.




7.Segmentation: 
The code defines a function, get_window(), to extract a window of 
data from the input array. The get_features() function is used to 
compute features for each window of the input data.



8.Model Classification: 
The code imports the SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier from sklearn.svm
 and creates an instance of the classifier with the SVC() function. 
The SimpleImputer class is also imported from sklearn.impute to handle missing
 values in the data. The fit() method is used to train the imputer on the training data
, and the transform() method can be used to transform the training and testing data.
